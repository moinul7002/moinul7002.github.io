In the case of candidate recruitment, different government organizations, nowadays, ask the applicants to submit their applications or resumes written in Bengali in the form of electronic documents. Matching the skills with the requirements and choosing the best candidates manually from all the resumes written in Bengali is very difficult and time-consuming. To make the recruitment process more comfortable, we have developed an automated candidate selection system. First, it takes the CVs (written in Bengali) of candidates and the employer’s requirements as input. It extracts information from the candidate’s CV using Bangla Language Processing (BLP) and Word2Vec embedding. Then, it generates an average cosine similarity score for each CV. Finally, it ranks the candidates according to the average cosine similarity scores and returns the dominant candidate’s list.","title":"ICO 2020","desc":"An Automated Candidate Selection System using Bangla Language Processing"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ico-2020"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
